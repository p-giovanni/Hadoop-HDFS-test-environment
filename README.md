# Hadoop HDFS test environment
This project aims to create a test environment for programs using [Hadoop HDFS](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/hdfs_design.html).

It is just a collection of configuration items and a few scripts that starts the Hadoop docker and that create some HDFS files to be used in the tests.

## Project status

## Disclaimer
Beware, I have checked the the configurations and the scripts as carefully as I can but nevertheless do not take for granted my result, check by yourself my code and decide if it it is correct or not.
